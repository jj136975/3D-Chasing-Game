I wanted to make a 3D raycaster where the player had to chase rabbits and shoot them in a Doom-like style
but unfortunately time was missing to me, so I tried my best to make a working raycaster engine.

With only a few days I could have finished it, but I hope you will find this project cool ^.^

You can simply run it in any IDE (Eclipse or IDEA) or watch the demo I have added in the zip.

Note: I've only tested on Java 17

Features:
 - High configurability, everything can be changed
 - Very optimized and no memory leaks
 - Can process on directional light source (white only)
 - Rendering and game updates can be made async
 - Easy to modify the map and add/change textures
